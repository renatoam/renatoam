I'm an in-love software developer with 7+ years in web development. I have been helping companies to deliver great user experiences and performative solutions. Today, I work as a Developer, Software Architect, and Tech Lead.

As a developer, I mainly work using React, TypeScript, Node (Express), and their respective ecosystems. But also can work with other frameworks like Angular and NestJS.

As a Software Architect, besides creating and planning solutions for web apps, I like to work on simplifying communication with diagrams, testing, and improving software with a strong emphasis on clean code and best practices. I also handle code reviews, pair programming, and actively share knowledge with the dev team to keep our squad in top shape.

As a Technical Lead, I keep things running smoothly, manage priorities, and handle any crises that may arise. I provide feedback, support the team's professional development, and ensure our team is a welcoming and collaborative environment.

I can't wait to bring my skills and enthusiasm to your business. If you'd like to discuss how I can contribute further, please let me know.
