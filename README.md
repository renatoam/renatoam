# Renato Melo

Front-End Developer completely in love with the profession, I discovered that one of my favorite hobbies - and I have many - is to study programming. Today, I consider myself a web development evangelist.

With daily study and participation in renowned projects such as Carrefour, Peugeot/Citroen, Hering, SESC, government projects, among others, I keep myself focused on the goal of becoming a full web developer, Javascript skilled.

The full web developer that I want to become can handle from conception to solution delivery, going through User Experience and User Interface development, delivering front-end, back -end and mobile, and ensuring the application deploy.

Of course that I don't want to become a specialist in all these stuffs, that's impossible, but having this background, although difficult, is very possível. The road is long, but so pleasant.

This is the way!
