As a software engineer I design, develop, test, deploy, maintain, and improve software. Always based on 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀, 𝗽𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀 and 𝗿𝗲𝗳𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀. I also like to propose coding best practices and code review strategies.

- 𝗕𝗲𝗲𝘀/𝗔𝗺𝗕𝗲𝘃: I have been working hard as a technical leader to help Bees to become a reliable B2B platform. I work on improving the codebase as well as improving the architecture. Also I guide people to reach out their best.
